This file accompanies 0.2 release of Medley

Medley is a record collection catalogue application which allows to
store information about albums, records, tracks and artists. It 
also supports assigning custam tags and ratings to stored items.
In future it will also allow to generate reports and rankings and 
track auditions and lending of items. 
Medley currently runs under Microsoft Windows and Linux operating 
systems. Please note, that since Windows is the primary development
platform, less stability should be expected from Linux version.

For general building and installation instructions see the file
install.txt.

Medley is free software. See the file license.txt for license details.
